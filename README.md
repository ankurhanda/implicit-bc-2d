Implicit Behaviour Cloning implementation https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00137

The repo containes a 2D example of implicit behaviour cloning. The task is regress the 2D coordinates corresponding to a red pixel in the image. Below are the results with implicit models. The blue dots represent the pixels <=1 pixel error. The green triangles are training data points.
